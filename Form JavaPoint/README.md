This app shows a basic appbar and a form.

The form has a heading text, three text fields and a submit button.

Each individual textfields show a label field and a hint message if you click it. The fields verify whether the fields are empty or not. If they are, you cannot submit the form. If all the fields are valid (non-empty), then it allows you submit the form. You can see an error message if you try to submit an "invalid" form at each invalid field.

On clicking the submit button, it shows a snackbar at the bottom of the screen showing a "Progressing data" message (code for this is copied form tutorial only).
