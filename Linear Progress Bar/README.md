This app shows a basic appbar with title, a floating button and a Linear Progress Indicator. 

The button increases the progress of the bar by 20% at every click and reset it to 0 if it is already full. The button also shows a hint on hovring the cursor above it.

The progress indicator shows various color as progress increases. The colors are hardcoded right now but I will look into randmizing that task. Currently, it shows 5 different colors as the it progresses. It resets both the indicator color and background color, with indicator showing slightly darker complexetion of the background color.
