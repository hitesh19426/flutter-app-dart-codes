# flutter-app-dart-codes
This repo contains dart files of flutter apps that I have written.

Each folder has a separate readme file to provide description of the app.

# TO-DO: 
1. Add flutter project instead of just dart code, they are more useful.
2. Add screenshots in sub-folder readme to show working along with description.
3. Suggestion: You can add a different repo containing all projects and attach that link here.

# Run:
1. Copy code and paste it [here](https://dartpad.dev/?null_safety=true)
2. Click run
